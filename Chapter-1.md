# Design Patterns: Making CSS Easy!

<p>On the surface, CSS seems easy. It has 45 commonly used properties you can employ to style a 
document. Below the surface, different combinations of properties and property values trigger 
completely different results. I call this CSS polymorphism because the same property has many 
meanings. The result of CSS polymorphism is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. </p>

<br>

<p>Together, Chapters 1 through 16 present over 300 design patterns created by combining 45 common 
CSS properties with four types of elements (inline, inline-block, block, and table) and five types of 
positioning (static, relative, absolute, fixed, and float). </p>

<br>

<p>This is the great power of design patterns: it is easy to take basic patterns and combine them to form 
more complex patterns. This makes learning CSS easy, and it makes using CSS very productive. Chapters 
17 through 20 show how to combine these design patterns to create fluid layouts, drop caps, callouts, 
quotes, and alerts. </p>
